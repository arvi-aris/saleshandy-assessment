An deployment monitoring application for my work
-------------------------------------------------

I worked for this in my free time, 

I was experimenting with ElectronJS Documentation, and at the time, we were having hard time managing deployed IPs, So to solve this problem I have built this. 

What it does is,
	1) We can enter IP series ( like 192.X.X ) and application will scan all IPs and finds out which are alive and which are down. 
	2) And those alive IPs are pinged and application will display version ,build details and link in a card view (used material-ui)
	3) Search and filter based on version and IP
	4) Seperate view for down nodes, so deployment can be done hassle-free

Its in two forms : 
	Desktop application ( Windows and Linux compatible ) and Web form.

Many of my colleagues have the desktop application in their local system and the web application is deployed as well. I'm kinda feel proud of this.

Desktop application is built upon ElectronJS. 

Web application in fine-tuned and I have used React for Front-end and NodeJS for Backend. I learned both technologies on my own since we dont use any of that in my work. 

I learned a lot while doing this, and I was appreciated and got an award for this.
